## What is git and how to use it? 

Git (or github.com) is a software with several functionalities. We are only going to be using a few of them. 
It allows multiple people to work on the same project or even same file. So how do we use this? 

### Objective: 
At the beginning of each assignment, I will be giving you all very few test cases. Over the course of the assignment, you will come up with your own test cases and add them to the "input" file. 

#### How to make changes to the 'input' file?
- This is slightly complicated, but don't worry. Firstly, make an account on github.com
- Go to [https://github.com/regstrtn/summer-coding](https://github.com/regstrtn/summer-coding). This is the 'repository', or 'folder' containing all our assignments. Now this repository/folder is owned by me, so you can't make any changes to it directly.  
- At the top right, there will be a green colored "Clone or download" button. Click on it. This will create a copy of the repository in your own account. 
- In your cloned repository, navigate to a1 folder. There you will see the file "input1". 
- Download the file, add test cases to it. Then again, in the top right, you will see "Upload files" button. Click on it, upload your "input" file, click the green Commit button at the bottom. 

#### How to 'push' those changes to the original repository that is owned by me? 
- Navigate to my original repository. At the top, you will see a few tabs, the third tab is called "Pull requests". Click on it. 
- There will be a green colored button "New Pull Request". Click on it. Follow the instructions, and done. :) Now I can go and approve that request and your test cases will show up in the original test cases file. Now anyone can download and test their code on those test cases.
